          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I´m a down to earth person who like to have structure and order in the daily life, if
            possible. But I also like things that twists routines around and make you think outside
            the box. It´s important to have an open mind and be able to handle stress when it comes
            to changes in either work or daily life. And the rewards from managing these challenges
            are absolut thrilling sometimes. During all my years in the service business I´ve
            learned a lot about myself when it comes to handle conflicts with either a customer or a
            task that´s challenging. Be humble and take step back and reassess is a good tip. The
            best part of working in a team is the support and confidence you build up together and
            help others to achieve their goals. I like to have responsibility, because it gives me
            the chance to show what I'm capable of. In my spare time my family comes first, after
            that I unwind with either videogames or an outdoor photo session.

          <h2>Why Front End?</h2>
          <p>
            After almost 20 years in customer service business, I´ve decided to take the giant step
            to head back to school to chase an old dream. And that is to work in the IT business.
            After some collaboration with some friends who works in different It-areas, I realized
            that i want to work with problem-solving but at the same time being creative. And here
            is where the Front-end development comes in. As far as I know today, it fills all my
            expectations of what I want to work with. I want a challenge, and this is the way.
