## Title: My Cv resume Project
[Link To My Page](https://gunnaring.github.io/My-CV-Resume/)


### Description:
In this project I shall introduce myself and show my earlier projects in a portfolio. I´m making the page interactive with JS and to increase the Ux overall. You´ll have access to my CV on the page also.

### Challenges:
* Wish I hade more time :D 
* The positioning with the Css
* Keeping order with classes and the Css

### My thoughts:
It was a fun project that put almost all of my skills to the test. I wish I had more time to add more JS. This time my initial thought was to start mobile first then desktop. Started with the navbar in mobile and after that 
by some reason I went all in with the desktop, this made things a little bit trickier to maintain order in the Css. Eventuly things came together pretty nicley. I freestyled the whole project and next time I think im gonna do 
a figma sketch before and dont change duiring the coding.
